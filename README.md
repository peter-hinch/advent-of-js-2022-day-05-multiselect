# Advent of JS 2022 - Day 5 - Multi-Select

This is my submission for day 4 of the [Advent of JS](https://www.adventofjs.com/) challenge.

For my submissions to Advent of JS, I have taken the approach of first completing the corresponding challenge in the [Advent of CSS](https://www.adventofcss.com/) and then building the functionality for the JS challenge on top. For this challenge I have chosen to work with React.js and typescript.

The requirements for functionality can be viewed in the [README.md](./STARTER-FILES/README.md) included with the starter files.
